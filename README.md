# FactSnap - Live Fact-Checker

## Overview
**FactSnap** is a two-part system designed to assist in live transcription and fact-checking of spoken or recorded audio, as well as text-based sources such as YouTube videos. The system integrates advanced AI models and APIs to transcribe speech, extract factual statements, and verify their accuracy against supplementary web information.

> **Note**: The feature for identifying factual statements is still in progress and requires further refinement to enhance its accuracy and usability.

## Project Structure

### 1. Live Fact-Checker
Facilitates real-time transcription and fact-checking for spoken audio using microphone input.

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time audio transcription**: Uses OpenAI Whisper for live speech-to-text transcription.
- **Fact-checking integration**: Sends transcriptions to a fact-checking system (via Groq API) for validation against web sources.
- **Named entity detection**: Leverages spaCy to identify key data points such as dates, percentages, quantities, and monetary values.
- **User control**: Allows users to start, stop, and manage live recording sessions through a command-line interface.

#### How It Works:
1. The script records audio input from the user’s microphone in real time.
2. Transcribes the audio using Whisper's small model for efficiency.
3. Extracted entities and facts are sent to the Groq fact-checking API, which cross-references them with web sources.
4. Displays results with a verdict of "true" or "false" along with supporting evidence.

### 2. YouTube Fact-Checker
Analyzes factual content in YouTube videos by transcribing audio or extracting YouTube's autogenerated transcripts.

#### Key Features:
- **YouTube audio transcription**: Downloads and transcribes video audio using Whisper for high accuracy.
- **Fallback transcript retrieval**: Uses the YouTubeTranscriptAPI to retrieve text-based transcripts if audio transcription fails.
- **Factual statement extraction**: Identifies sentences containing numerical data, dates, or other factual entities using spaCy.
- **User-friendly input**: Accepts YouTube video URLs for processing.

#### How It Works:
1. Users input a YouTube video URL.
2. The script extracts the video ID and downloads the audio using yt-dlp.
3. Audio is transcribed with Whisper to generate the transcript. If this fails, the YouTubeTranscriptAPI fetches the video’s autogenerated transcript.
4. Displays identified factual statements for review or further validation.
